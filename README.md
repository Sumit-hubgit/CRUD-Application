# CRUD-Application
This application is designed to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using Spring Boot as the backend framework, MongoDB as the database, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

Key Features
CRUD Operations:

Create: Allows users to add new records to the MongoDB database.
Read: Enables fetching and displaying of records from the database.
Update: Provides functionality to modify existing records.
Delete: Facilitates the removal of records from the database.
Spring Boot:

Acts as the backbone of the application, providing a robust and scalable framework for building and deploying the application.
Utilizes Spring Data MongoDB to interact with the MongoDB database, leveraging its repository abstractions for easy data access and manipulation.
MongoDB:

Serves as the NoSQL database to store application data.
Offers flexibility in handling data schemas, making it suitable for dynamic and evolving datasets.
Spring Security:

Integrates authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application.
Implements user roles and permissions to control access to various endpoints and operations, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions.
Application Flow
User Authentication:

Users are required to log in with valid credentials.
Spring Security manages the authentication process, ensuring secure access.
User Authorization:

After authentication, user roles determine access levels.
Different roles (e.g., admin, user) have specific permissions to perform CRUD operations.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Users with appropriate permissions can add new entries via HTTP POST requests.
Read: Both authenticated and authorized users can fetch data using HTTP GET requests.
Update: Authorized users can update existing entries with HTTP PUT/PATCH requests.
Delete: Users with delete permissions can remove entries via HTTP DELETE requests.
Data Management:

Data is stored in MongoDB collections.
Spring Data MongoDB handles data interactions, providing a seamless interface for performing CRUD operations.
Security Implementation
Password Encoding: Utilizes BCryptPasswordEncoder to securely hash passwords.
JWT Tokens: Optionally, JWT tokens can be used for stateless authentication, enhancing security and scalability.
Access Control: Configures method-level security using annotations (e.g., @PreAuthorize) to restrict access based on user roles.
Conclusion
This CRUD application demonstrates a comprehensive integration of Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Spring Security. It provides a secure, scalable, and flexible solution for managing data with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that data integrity and access control are maintained.
